| About Reliability? | Cloud hosting is highly reliable because it uses multiple servers. If one server fails, others pick up the load to ensure your website or app stays online. It also handles high traffic smoothly, avoiding downtime during surges.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
