# Overview of the Architechture of Proxmox VE
In this drawn architechture of **Proxmox VE**, we clearly see that `Proxmox VE` **runs directly on the underlying hardware without the need to use an operating system as an underlying layer**, For this Proxmox VE are considered as `type-1` hypervisors, also called `bare-metal` hypervisors. As a result, maximum performance is achieved.
