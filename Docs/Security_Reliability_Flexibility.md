# Security
Security in hosting ensures your website or app is protected from threats like hacking, data breaches, or malware. It involves measures like firewalls, encryption, regular updates, and monitoring for vulnerabilities. Data security is vital for hosting platforms. As companies use these hosting to store sensitive information, accidental leaks or cyber-attacks are risks that can cause serious harm.  It’s a set of security procedures (authentication, resource access control, data privacy protection, and so on) that protect hosting infrastructure and everything it stores. Hosting platform security also assists firms in adhering to international regulatory norms such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
# Reliability
When you connect to a hosting platform, your website or application should run smoothly, with uninterrupted access to your data. A reliable hosting platform ensures that your products and services function correctly, minimizing risks of downtime or performance issues. Unreliable hosting can lead to financial losses and damage to your company's reputation. When selecting a hosting service, consider its reliability. Key indicators of a reliable hosting platform include comprehensive service level agreements (SLAs), load balancing capabilities, failover procedures, monitoring systems, backup processes, disaster recovery plans, and a proven track record of excellent uptime and performance.
# Flexibility
Flexibility, on the other hand, is about the hosting service's ability to adapt to changing needs. This includes scalability (adjusting resources as needed), customization options, support for various platforms, and the ability to integrate with other services. Flexibility can be assessed by looking at the range of configurations available, ease of scaling, and variety of supported technologies.
