# Foundation Building

- **Resource Management**: How hypervisors allocate and isolate CPU, RAM, and storage for VMs.
- **Scaling Mechanisms**: The methods used to scale resources dynamically.
- **Storage Solutions**: Techniques like block storage, object storage, and distributed file systems.
- **Cluster Management**: The role of clustering in ensuring high availability and load balancing.
- **Database Services**: How a VPS can integrate with database systems to offer Database-as-a-Service (DBaaS) functionality.
- Learning the basics of network configurations, and server operations.
- Gaining insights into containerization and orchestration tools.
# VPS Core Functionality

1. **Virtualization**: A hypervisor creates virtual machines (VMs) on physical hardware.
2. **Resource Allocation**: CPU, RAM, and storage are dedicated to each VM.
3. **Networking**: Configured via virtual switches and VLANs to isolate or connect VMs.
# Services Provided By Core Functionality
### **Scaling on Demand**

- Uses hypervisors to dynamically allocate additional resources.
- Supports live migration to redistribute workloads without downtime.

### **Managing VMs and Clusters**

- **VM Management**: Create, configure, and monitor VMs through tools or APIs.
- **Cluster Management**: Hypervisors manage clusters for high availability and failover support.

### **Storage Management**

- **Types**: Local storage, network-attached storage (NAS), and storage area networks (SANs).
- **Backups and Snapshots**: Enable disaster recovery and easy scaling.

### **Providing Database Services**

- Integrates database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB.
- Uses containerized or VM-based solutions to offer scalable and isolated DBaaS.
# Popular OpenSource VPS management Tools

- Proxmox VE
- VirtualBox
- KVM/QEMU
- OpenStack
# Why should we Reverse Engineer These?

- **Learn Architectures**: Understand how resource allocation, virtualization layers, and networking work.
- **Understand Scalability**: Analyze how these platforms implement dynamic scaling and high availability.
- **Gain Debugging Skills**: Develop skills to troubleshoot and optimize virtual environments.
